# Short Bio

# About
My career bridges technology, product strategy, and engineering—shaped by years of solving problems in fast-paced, high-stakes environments. I enjoy connecting technical execution with strategic thinking, ensuring that products and systems deliver real value to the people who use them. I thrive where curiosity, clarity, and follow-through are essential.  

Athletics has been a constant thread in my life, from competing as an NCAA swimmer to now coaching youth climbing at [Movement Gyms](https://movementgyms.com) in Sunnyvale, CA. Coaching has reinforced my belief that progress is as much about mindset and perseverance as it is about skill—and that applies equally to sport, technology, and life.  

I’m passionate about building both people and products, finding that the most rewarding work comes from guiding others, collaborating openly, and tackling challenges with a mix of discipline and creativity.
