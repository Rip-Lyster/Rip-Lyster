        <h1>Short Bio</h1>
        <p>I&#x2019;m a technologist and product thinker with a Carnegie Mellon engineering background, a lifelong passion for athletics, and a knack for turning complex challenges into clear, actionable solutions. Whether in the climbing gym or the product lab, I&#x2019;m driven by growth, discipline, and helping others reach their potential.</p>

        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>My career bridges technology, product strategy, and engineering&#x2014;shaped by years of solving problems in fast-paced, high-stakes environments. I enjoy connecting technical execution with strategic thinking, ensuring that products and systems deliver real value to the people who use them. I thrive where curiosity, clarity, and follow-through are essential.</p>
        <p>Athletics has been a constant thread in my life, from competing as an NCAA swimmer to now coaching youth climbing at <a href="https://movementgyms.com">Movement Gyms</a> in Sunnyvale, CA. Coaching has reinforced my belief that progress is as much about mindset and perseverance as it is about skill&#x2014;and that applies equally to sport, technology, and life.</p>
        <p>I&#x2019;m passionate about building both people and products, finding that the most rewarding work comes from guiding others, collaborating openly, and tackling challenges with a mix of discipline and creativity.</p>
